The elements within tuples cannot be changed, they are permanent. 
 

tuple1 = ("Honda", "Civic", 4, 2017) 
tuple1[1]                                                  # "Civic" - calls out for element in index 1 
len(tuple1)                                               # 4 - four elements within the tuple
